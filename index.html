        Muttom sports a beautiful and tidy beach. Huge rocks standing at either
        sides of the beach give the beach a pristine look. Since the beach is
        usually less crowded, it makes an excellent spot for tourists to enjoy
        its beauty. There is also a children's park and a Christian retreat
        centre called the 'Rock Bible centre' just in view of the beach. Muttom
        has a lighthouse due to which its presence is recorded in the
        international shipping chart. This lighthouse was constructed by British
        during colonial Time. The lighthouse, though near the sea, is situated
        110 ft. (34 m) above sea level. The skeleton was built when India was
        part of the British Empire until 1947.

        There are hardly any such beaches in the coasts of Tamilnadu with such
        huge rocks. Waves rising high and splashing on the huge rocks are a
        sight to watch. Sitting there on a rock with feet on the water, the
        sight of the waves and the sound of the ocean is pleasing to the senses.
        The steep rocky shores of Muttom Beach are guarded with stainless steel
        fences. There are huts and benches at Muttom Beach, for visitors to sit
        and watch the sun set and the sea. The beach is one of the rare beaches
        with huge rocks on which the waves break constantly.
